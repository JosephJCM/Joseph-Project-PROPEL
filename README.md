Hello! The dataset I decided to use is "The Complete Pokemon Dataset", taken from Kaggle. This dataset contains all information of the names, types, abilities, stats, and other factors pertaining to each Pokemon from generation 1-7. Due to my interest in Pokemon since childhood, I thought this would be a fun dataset to experiment with and take a more exploratory approach to in regard to analysis. 
Questions that I wanted to answer through analysis and visualization are present throughout the notebook but some examples include:
How many Pokemon are introduced within each generation? 
Which Pokemon primary type has the best/worst mean stats (combination of defense, attack, speed, special defense, and special attack)?
How many grass types (my favorite type) are introduced in each generation?

I also utilized ChatGPT to a large extent to learn/experiment with the coding I performed in this project.
